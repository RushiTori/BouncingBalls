DONE | draw balls with a texture
DONE | elastic collisions
DONE | make window resizable

TO DO | arrow keys change the brightness of the background

TO DO | option to make all the balls the same size

TO DO | implement Ball color schemes
	(default)      RGB random
	(not done yet) HUE random
	(not done yet) brightness based on kinetic energy

TO DO | optimize the elastic collision algorithm
	(not done yet) try to remove some memory read
	(not done yet) implement spatial hash

TO DO | make use of brk/sbrk/mmap to have access to more memory for the program
	(done)         determine which of these to use
	(done)         determine why not use malloc/free instead
	(not done yet) use mmap and see if it impacts FPS

TO DO | let the user choose the number of balls at program start
